			<h1>CCTV Camera</h1>
			<p>These images are of CCTV cameras located around different places, which are relatively close to each other, in Wellington City. A CCTV camera, or 'closed-circuit television', is a TV system. Its purpose is not to be publicly distributed, but to monitor primarily for security and surveillance purposes.</p>

				<p>A camera I saw as I got off an elevator down Lambton Quay. This was right outside a dairy in a small enclosed area so of course there has to be a camera in this area.</p>

				<p>A surveillance camera outside a large building down the Terrace. There are a lot of cars and carparks in this area and the camera's placement and focus must be on the cars that come and go.</p>

			<h1>Wifi Modem</h1>
			<p>Something that is a little more obvious in its relation with th internet is wifi modems. Looking around all the spaces I spend the majority of my time in there is always wifi modems; at my home (a hostel) and at university. Wifi has become a norm in society where it's almost essential that we have wifi in order to work from home and to access applications like Netflix.</p>

			<h1>Cables</h1>
			<p>Everywhere we walk, there's always cables. They can be on the powerline poles or even on the road. But what do they do? Are they interconnected to the internet? Are they an infrastructure of Wellington? All these questions but what's the answer? Well, I chose cables as part of this just because I always see them where ever I am walking.</p>
