		<h3>Grids</h3>

		<p>Use grids to divide up or layout content. For example, putting an image on the left, and lots to text on the right</p>

		<p>I've added a 'show' class so you can see where the grids are. Use chrome's web inspector tools to take a closer look</p>


		<div class="g-row show"> <!--first wrap all grid cells in a g-row-->
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50% width .g-50
			</div>

			<div class="g-30 show">
				30% width .g-30
			</div>

			<div class="g-70 show">
				70% width .g-70
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>The other cool things about grids, is that 50% width means 50% of the div's <em>parent</em>. This means you can put cells in cells to get infinitly smaller sizes. The possiblities are endless!</p>

		<div class="g-row show"> <!--first wrap all grid cells in a g-row-->
			<div class="g-50 show">
				<div class="g-50 show">
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
					<div class="g-50 show">
						50%
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="g-50 show">
					50%
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="g-50 show">
				50%
			</div>

		<p>Here's a simple page using all of these elements</p>

			<h1>CCTV Camera</h1>
			<p>These images are of CCTV cameras located around different places, which are relatively close to each other, around Wellington Central. A CCTV camera, or 'closed-circuit television', is a TV system. Its purpose is not to be publicly distributed, but to monitor primarily for security and surveillance purposes.</p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera One</h3>
				<p>This first CCTV camera is a camera outside a hostel located on the Terrace in Central Wellington.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cam2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera Two</h3>
				<p>A second CCTV camera which is not so hidden as it has a sign to warn people. This is inside the same hostel as the first camera and is different in its design.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cam3.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera Three</h3>
				<p>This tiny camera located in the same hostel as the first and second cameras. Much more smaller and it's placement is in right in front of the main office.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cam4.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera Four</h3>
				<p>A camera I saw as I got off an elevator down Lambton Quay. This was right outside a dairy in a small enclosed area so of course there has to be a camera in this area.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cam5.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera Five</h3>
				<p>A surveillance camera outside a large building down the Terrace. There are a lot of cars and carparks in this area and the camera's placement and focus must be on the cars that come and go.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="g-row">
			<div class="g-30">
				<img src="img/cam6.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Camera Six</h3>
				<p>Outside another hostel in Wellington. Clearly obvious that it is there as it is not hidden at all.</p>
